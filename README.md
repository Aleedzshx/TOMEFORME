# TOME_FORME
At 18, I decided to build my career with an international vision. I am preparing to study Software Engineering in 2026, incorporating technical English, real projects, and a global community. My goal: to reach 23 with experience, impact, and purpose.

Something to add: I want to practice everything in general, like SQL, Python, JavaScript, etc. I just want to learn as much as I can about everything.
